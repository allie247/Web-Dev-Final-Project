            <p>
                Hanna’s hands down favorite bar in Burlington is RiRa's! It has been serving lunch and dinner every day since 1999. 
                Around 10:00 pm on Fridays and Saturdays many of the tables are moved and a DJ stand will be set up at the top of the stairs. 
                It is a go-to place for many UVM juniors and seniors and people in their 20s for dancing.

                Located on the corner of North Winooski and Pearl, CNX Thai Cooking is a great spot for good priced food with large portions. 
                There isn’t much seating inside so it is mostly a takeout place. 
                Hanna’s favorite dish there is the Pad See Ew with tofu, she typically takes it to go and walks to the waterfront to enjoy the delicious food with a view!

                A study spot staple for many students is Dobra Tea, with a wide variety of different teas and snacks to pick from. 
                It is a quiet and peaceful place to do work, read a book or chat with some friends. 
                Hanna loves to go there to treat herself to a nice warm cup of Kenyan black tea and a cookie dough brownie while getting some assignments done. 
                The staff there are amazing and it is always good to support local business!

                Owned by the Episical Church in Vermont but open to the public, Rock Point Commons is a wonderful slice of nature in the heart of Burlington. 
                It offers beautiful views of Lake Champlain and the Adirondack Mountains along the cliff and a passage down to the shore. 
                When on the shoreline, you can witness an awesome geologic formation that Hanna loves, that is the Champlain Valley thrust fault.

            </h4>
            <p>
                An underrated activity that most people visiting Burlington and UVM miss is taking the time to explore Centennial Woods. 
                It is owned by UVM and offers great trails to run and walk on while being pretty secluded from the congestion of campus. 
                Hanna finds the woods incredibly peaceful and a good spot for birding.

            <p>
                Along Church Street there is plenty of shopping for clothes and household items but if you're in need of a new book, Hanna suggests Phoenix books! 
                It's a small business but has many new releases and great picks in every genre. 
                They have a good selection of local works too!
