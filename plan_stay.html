    <h2>Getting around</h2>
    <p>
        The city of Burlington is very walkable but if you want to venture farther a car is needed. There is also a public bus, Green Mountain Transit, that is super reliable. 
        Using the Transit app, you can input your current location and where you want to go, then it will give you a close bus stop with a route you’ll want to take. You can track the bus on the map as it is making its way toward you. 
        For a single fare it is $2.00 but if you’re a UVM student it’s free as long as you show your cat card.
