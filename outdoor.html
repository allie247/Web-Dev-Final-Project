    <p>
        The Burlington area hosts many amazing outdoor activities between the lake, forests and mountains. 
    </p>
    <h2>Bike the Causeway</h2>
        <p>
            A must do when in Burlington during the summertime is biking the causeway! You can start anywhere on Island Line Trail in Burlington and end up on South Hero Island. It is a flat ride with amazing views of Lake Champlain, Winooski River and different parks in the area. 
        </p>
    <h2>Cold Plunge at Leddy Beach</h2>
        <p>
            Locals in Burlington still swim in Lake Champlain during the colder months. Running into the chilly water at Leddy Beach is a great way to embrace the Vermont winter. Leddy beach is the quieter of the two beaches and is open year round. Great spot for a polar plunge!
        </p>
    <h2>Fish at Salmon Hole</h2>
        <p>
            In between Burlington and Winooski, there is a park called Salmon Hole that many locals rave about for fishing. In late spring and early summer you can find bass, salmon and sturgeons, just make sure to follow Vermont fishing rules and regulations. 
        </p>
    <h2>Swim at North Beach</h2>
        <p>
            North Beach is a hot spot during a sunny, warm day in Burlington. It’s great for swimming, tanning and even a cookout. North beach is very popular with college students as well as families and people looking for some sun. You can use the beach as a take off point for paddleboarding, canoeing or kayaking.
        </p>
    <h2>Go Sledding at Burlington County Club</h2>
        <p>
            Known to many UVM students, behind Redstone Campus is the Burlington Country Club. During the winter when the golf course is abandoned, many college students go there for some sledding. The hill is super steep and you can pick up quite the speed going down.
