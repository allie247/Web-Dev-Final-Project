                Bike the Causeway
            </h4>
            <p>
                A must do when in Burlington during the summertime is biking the causeway! 
            You can start anywhere on Island Line Trail in Burlington and end up on South Hero Island. 
            It is a flat ride with amazing views of Lake Champlain, Winooski River and different parks in the area.

                Cold Plunge at Leddy Beach
            </h4>
            <p>
                Locals in Burlington still swim in Lake Champlain during the colder months. 
                Running into the chilly water at Leddy Beach is a great way to embrace the Vermont winter. 
                Leddy beach is the quieter of the two beaches and is open year round. 
                Great spot for a polar plunge!
