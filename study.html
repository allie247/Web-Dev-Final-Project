    </section>
    <p>Having a nice place to get work and studying done is a very important part of being a student at Univeristy of Vermont. </p>
    <h3>On Campus:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Howe Library: the largest of the three libraries on campus with three floor, getting quieter with each level. The first floor is a great place to get group work done or chat with friends. The second and third floor is a great place to get studying done on your own. </li>
        <li>Hendersons: a coffee shop in the Davis Center on campus. This is a busier atmosphere for people who like to work with background noise. </li>
        <li>Billings Library: this is a smaller library on campus with a historical feel. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Off Campus</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fletcher: this is a public library downtown, for the times you need to take a walk and get away from campus.  </li>
        <li>Kru Coffee: Coffee shop at the top of Church Street downtown Burlington. They have great coffee and food and comfortable seating. </li>
    </ul>
